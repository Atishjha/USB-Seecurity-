Future Update that i want to integrate 
1. HARDEN THE CORE SYSTEM
 Add Kernel-Level USB Event Monitoring

Your current system relies on WinAPI / WMI / polling.
Improve by using:

Windows Driver Framework (KMDF/UMDF)

Write a minimal UMDF driver to intercept USB mount events more reliably

This also prevents spoofed events and bypasses

 Enforce Real Read-Only Mounts

Right now, you simulate read-only by blocking operations.
Better:

Use Windows Diskpart / VDS_* APIs / IOCTL_DISK_SET_READONLY

Apply read-only before the drive is assigned a letter

Block autoruns and shortcut-based malware instantly

Process Isolation (Sandbox Scanning Worker)

Run:

USB watcher

Scanner engine

Policy executor

UI dashboard

as separate processes, with the scanning engine running:

In low-integrity mode

Possibly inside Windows Sandbox (optional)

2. ADVANCED SECURITY FEATURES
 Multi-Engine Scanning

Add support for:

ClamAV (already present)

Windows Defender MpCmdRun

VirusTotal API (hash-based first, file-based only if needed)

Multi-engine scanning drastically improves detection of zero-days.

 Real-Time Heuristic Monitoring

Your heuristic engine can be expanded:

Behavior-based rules

Unexpected creation of .lnk files

Scripts dropped to root

Mass attribute changes (hidden/system)

PowerShell execution triggered by drive insertion

Suspicious entropy spikes (possible packed malware)

ML-based anomaly detection (optional)

Train on “normal USB structure” vs “abnormal”

Detect ransomware droppers or obfuscated payloads by patterns

Trusted Device Fingerprinting

Fingerprint every USB device using:

VID/PID

Serial number

Storage size

File system

Volume label

First-seen timestamp

Then categorize as:

Trusted

Restricted

Never trust (ban list)
